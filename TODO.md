# Todo

-   [ ] Make x and y config values hidden (and remove some of the weird code in CoinTracker that changes pos)
-   [ ] Clean up/improve gui editor 
    -   add reset positions button
    -   make squares behind the gui objects
    -   dragging is better and only changes the closest (and within 10 pixels) gui object
    -   make Math.floor in Util#getPercent/PosFromPos/Percent Math.round
    -   loop through list of features?
-   [ ] More reliable position calculator (fix weird bug where fullscreen 100% x would move the text off the screen)
-   [ ] XP tracker
-   [ ] Win/kill counter?
