# Todo

-   Add limits (`Math.min(100, Math.round(etc...))`) to the getPercentFromPos and getPosFromPercent
-   Clean up/improve gui editor 
    -   make squares behind the gui objects
    -   dragging is better and only changes the closest (and within 10 pixels) gui object
-   XP tracker
-   Win/kill counter?
